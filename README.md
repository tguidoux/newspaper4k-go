A Go library for extracting and parsing articles from web pages. This is a Go implementation of [newspaper4k](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k), inspired by the [newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) Python library. It provides functionality to scrape article content, extract metadata such as title, authors, publish date, and more from HTML pages or URLs.

**Note:** This library does not support all features of newspaper4k yet, but it can successfully parse articles! Pull requests are welcome to add more features.

## Installation

To use this module in your Go project, you can use the `go get` command:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/tguidoux/newspaper4k-go
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/tguidoux/newspaper4k-go/pkg/newspaper4k"
)

func main() {
	// Extract article from URL
	article, err := newspaper4k.NewArticleFromURL("https://example.com/article")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Title: %s\n", article.Title)
	fmt.Printf("Authors: %v\n", article.Authors)
	fmt.Printf("Text: %s\n", article.Text)
	fmt.Printf("Publish Date: %v\n", article.PublishDate)

	// Or extract from HTML string
	html := `<html><body><h1>Test Article</h1><p>This is the content.</p></body></html>`
	article2, err := newspaper4k.NewArticleFromHTML(html)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Title: %s\n", article2.Title)
}
```
